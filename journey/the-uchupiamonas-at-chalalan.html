<p>In the late 80s,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Uchupiamonas were preparing themself for a grim future. They were an impoverished indigenous group located north of La Paz in a sparsely populated area of rain forest. They lacked basic support from the Bolivian government in health, education and services. When 40 local families migrated in search of better conditions, the community realized they needed to take action. They looked towards the forest, animals, rivers and lakes, where their ancestors had looked before them. They decided that Ecological Tourism was the answer. With the support of Joseph Ginsber, an Israeli adventurer who was rescued in the Tuichi Valley after a harrowing strugle for survival, they launched the Chalalan Ecolodge, on the shores of the Chalalan lagoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, travelers embark on a 30 minute flight from La Paz over the sprawling forest and take a five hour boat ride up river to reach the secluded Chalalan Lodge. Here, you can explore the forest with local indigenious guides who will help you spot the plethora of wildlife including&nbsp;howler monkeys, spider monkeys, tapirs, deer, capybaras, frogs, lizards and maybe even jaguars.&nbsp;You will also take part in a night of traditions. On the last evening of your stay in Chalal&aacute;n you can try the traditional &ldquo;dunucuavi&rdquo; dinner (catfish wrapped in leaf)&nbsp;and then enjoy a night of traditional music, dancing and storytelling. A guide will be with you to explain the traditions and customs of the people from San Jos&eacute; de Uchupiamonas.</p> </div>

<h4>Minimize environmental impact</h4>
<p>Chalalan has implemented a liquid waste treatment system (for bathrooms, kitchen and showers) which combines the power of the sun and biological processes to guarantee a minimum impact on the surrounding environment. This technique is certified by the Bolivian Ministry of Sustainable Development and the Environment’s environmental manifesto. Solid waste is separated with organic waste going to a compost heap and inorganic waste is collected by the Rurrenabaque municipal refuse collection service. In Chalalán solar energy is used to light the bedrooms and shared areas of the Ecolodge. Batteries are only used for torches and the use of fossil fuels is kept to a minimum.<br />
Water is purified by treatment with special filters. It is also boiled and then is stored in closed containers for later use in the preparation of drinks and food.</p>
